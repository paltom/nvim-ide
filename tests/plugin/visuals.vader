Execute (Check colorscheme settings):
  AssertEqual 1, g:one_allow_italics
  AssertEqual 1, &termguicolors
  AssertEqual "one", trim(execute("colorscheme"))

Execute (Scroll up with full window of text):
  for i in range(winheight(0)*2 + 10)
    call append(0, "xxx")
  endfor
  execute "normal! 50%"
  execute "normal! M"
  execute "normal! ".winheight(0)/2."k"

Then (Cursor is in line below scrolloff value):
  AssertEqual 4, winline()

Execute (Scroll down with full window of text):
  for i in range(winheight(0)*2 + 10)
    call append(0, "xxx")
  endfor
  execute "normal! 50%"
  execute "normal! M"
  execute "normal! ".winheight(0)/2."j"

Then (Cursor is in line below scrolloff value):
  AssertEqual winheight(0)-3, winline()

Given (Some buffer):
  Line 1

Execute (Line number settings are correct):
  AssertEqual 1, &number, "Lines are not numbered"
  AssertEqual 1, &relativenumber, "Lines are not numbered relatively to current one"
  AssertEqual 5, &numberwidth, "Number column has wrong width (should be 5)"

Execute (Whitespace characters are displayed):
  AssertEqual 1, &list, "Whitespace characters displaying disabled"
  Assert index(map(split(&listchars, ","), 'split(v:val, ":")'), ["tab", "» "]) >= 0
  Assert index(map(split(&listchars, ","), 'split(v:val, ":")'), ["trail", "␣"]) >= 0
